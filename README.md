# ChessJS

### About this project
The goal of this project is to learn about programming in JS and to further hone my skills.
Ultimately, I do want to add an AI, but I won't be doing that until I can say that I have a working game of chess.
I realize that chess isn't the most advanced game to program, but I think it'll be a fun project to work on for a while.

I am open to suggestions, so if you want to send some ideas my way, feel free to email me;
I'd love to hear any tips, tricks, or things I could be doing better.

### Running the code
Currently, I don't have any special way to use the code I'm writing.
It's not hosted on a website anywhere (I might do that when I finish), so if you want to run the code you can download it and run it either by double clicking or by opening it in your web browser of choice.

Again, I don't have the AI working yet, so you'll be stuck with clicking around.
If you want to use this as a base for your own AI, please do so, and let me know what you did and how it worked.
