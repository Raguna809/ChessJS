# CheJS

### About this project

The goal of this project is to learn about programming in JS and to further hone
my skills. Ultimately, I do want to add an AI, but I won't be doing that until I
can say that I have a working game of chess. I realize that chess isn't the most
advanced game to program, but I think it'll be a fun project to work on for a
while.

I am open to suggestions, so if you want to send some ideas my way, feel free to
email me; I'd love to hear any tips, tricks, or things I could be doing better.

### Running the code

Currently, I don't have any special way to use the code I'm writing.
It's not hosted on a website anywhere (I might do that when I finish), so if you
want to run the code you can download it and run it either by double clicking or
by opening it in your web browser of choice.

Again, I don't have the AI working yet, so you'll be stuck with clicking around.
If you want to use this as a base for your own AI, please do so, and let me know
what you did and how it worked.

### TO DO:

##### Immediate goals

- make the pieces move
- restrict the movement of the pieces
- allow pieces to "capture" other pieces, thus removing pieces from the board
- use "capture" mechanic to further restrict the motion of the pieces
- restrict motion when in check
- add ending "checkmate" notification
- add option to reset the game

##### Future goals

- add "castle" mechanic
- restrict "castle" mechanic
- add highlighting for squares that are valid moves
- add draw mechanic

##### Distant goals

- add AI (I don't know how to do that yet, so this is as specific as it's going
  to get)
- release onto a website or some hosting platform (I might do this when I get my
  initial game working, so this might happen earlier)
- add multiplayer support (I also don't know how to do this yet, but I might try
  to learn it later)
